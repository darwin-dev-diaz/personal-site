      <div class="post-content"><div class="post-section"><p class="bt">In his book Deep Work, Cal Newport writes about how it’s not the best idea to use the internet as entertainment. </p><p class="bt">Reddit, YouTube, Twitter. The gripping nature of these platforms makes it so that if we have any boredom in our lives at all, we can easily off-set it with an instant distraction. Newport claims that by consuming these pieces of entertainment, me weaken our mind’s ability to resist distraction. </p><p class="bt">And as you may guess, an inability to resist distraction is disastrous for Deep Work. </p><p class="bt">Not giving into the shallow activities "tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people’s daily lives."  This quote perfectly incapulate how I feel when I just binge content. I feel like antsy. I feel like there’s always more to do.</p><p class="bt">Today I resolve to not just structure my work time, but to structure my down time as well with Deeply Relaxing activities.</p></div><div class="post-section"><h2 class="mon-red-text">Shift work today</h2><p class="bt">Today I’m working my day job from 4pm-12am. Sleep is most definitely take a hit.</p><p class="bt">I’m grateful for not having the option to go to work today. When I become financially free and my time is my own, I’ll look back at days like these. I’ll remember the feeling of my body feeling tired and hating me for making it move. I’ll remember having to resist the healthy biological urge to rest because my mind knows I need an hourly wage to survive right now. </p><p class="bt">I’m grateful to experience a low like this. When I’m traveling the states in my camper van, the high will just be so much higher after feeling these lows.</p></div><div class="post-section"><h2 class="mon-red-text">What learning looks like</h2><p class="bt">Today I completed the foundations section in Odin project, which is a huge milestone for me. I’m proud of myself for having endured and finding joy in the journey. </p><p class="bt">I’m now moving onto the Javascript road map. After completing this (I’ll assuming that I can finish this in 6 weeks), I’ll be finished with the prerequisites learning and the final goal for the end of the quarter will be to make a personal project, which I also cannot wait for!</p><p class="bt">For my personal site (the site you’re reading) I’m developing a JS script that parses a blog post in a .txt file and automatically generates the html needed for the post. </p><p class="bt">This will be the first project that I’ve made that actually helps someone - ME! </p><p class="bt">It’ll save me so much time because instead of writing a blog post piece by piece and making sure that every element looks good, I can just write an entire post in text file and have the code worry about the rest.</p><ul class="bt"><li>This </li><li>Unordered</li><li>List</li><li>Was </li><li>Formatted </li><li>With </li><li>Code</li><li>Ooooohhh</li><li>Yeahhhhhh</li></ul><p class="bt">I’m quite excited to have that finished.</p></div><div class="post-section"><h2 class="mon-red-text">On Running</h2><p class="bt">I need to get back into running. I want to see the benefits that Alex West is telling me are there with my own eyes…</p></div></div>
