            Not much happened today. I tapped into a community call in Adonis School and I learned from the Odin Project for about an hour. At the very least I can say that I'm keeping my momentum.

          <p class="bt">Ugh...</p>
          <p class="bt">While I love having a guest over it feels like there isn't any space for me to just be deep in my thoughts and reflect on my life. I'll probably take to myself at a cafe with my notebook after work today.</p>
