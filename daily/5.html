          <p class="bt">This has to be a common problem in relationships where one partner is focused on a higher goal.</p>
          <p class="bt">Yesterday was spent putting my life back in to nice organized boxes and I am a better man for it. I feel amazing today.</p>
          <p class="bt">Yesterday I cleaned my house, figured out a money plan that works for me (since these last two weeks took a toll on my wallet), made a meal plan and cooked a delicious meal, and I figured a way to catch my exercise momentum.</p>
          <p class="bt">Today I will ease back into my old identity. I will do one deep work block of writing and reflection and another deep work block of the Odin project.</p>
