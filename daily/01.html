          Let's see how this thing goes...

          <p class="bt">Today is the first day of my daily blog.</p>
          <p class="bt">From this point forward, I will wrap up the day with a blog post. This'll give me a chance to unwind and reflect on the day.</p>
          <p class="body-text">I'm excited to document this journey after reading <a href="https://www.alexwest.co/" class="body-link mon-red-text">Alex West's personal blog</a>. The transparency of indie hackers when it comes to their journeys and earnings is something I don't really see any where else. 
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            A few insights I've learned from Alex are:
          </p>
          <ul class="body-text">
            <li>Working first thing in the morning is crucial to establishing a good routine</li>
            <li>Discipline and motivation are waning resources so instead it's better to set up effortless routines to do whatever it is you have to do</li>
            <li>It's important to build and launch frequently, however, you should be aiming and firing, not just building whatever random idea comes to your head</li>
            <li>Keeping physically active is crucial</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body-text">
            My goal, as you may have read on the hero of my site, is to achieve financial freedom by building world-class Shopify apps. This is extremely feasible. After just $1,600 MRR I would have gotten rid of the need to work a normal job again. At $3,000 MRR I will have the freedom to do basically whatever I want. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="mon-red-text">What my current life looks like</h2>
          <p class="body-text">
            I live in what they call a mother-in-law apartment. Basically I live in the basement of some old lady. Rent isn't too bad. $900 for a decent suburban neighborhood where people have garages and can leave their cars unlocked.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            To sustain this mission I have to work normal jobs. I am a clerk at a grocery store that's just a 5 minute drive from my house. I really don't like it but I am not above whatever it takes to get to where I need to go.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            This is what my spending looks like in a week (monthly expenses are divided by 4):
          </p>

          <ul class="body-text">
            <li>Phone - $17.5</li>
            <li>Internet - $7.5</li>
            <li>Gas - $3</li>
            <li>Food - $70</li>
            <li>Rent - $225</li>
            <li>Laundry - $5</li>
            <li>Random expenses - $25</li>
            <li>TOTAL - $353</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="body-text">$353 * 4 = $1412</p>
          <p class="body-text">$1412 to survive a month...</p>
          <p class="body-text">I don't know about you but that seems like such a tiny amount of money. </p>
          <p class="body-text">Usually, I am pretty good a sticking to this budget but these last two weeks have not been optimal. You see, I have invited my closest friend and romantic partner from New Jersey over.</p>
          <p class="body-text">I've taken the last week to enjoy my time with her and also to finally enjoy this new state that I've moved to. You see, I've been on survival mode until recently.</p>
          <p class="body-text">So yeah, eating out everyday and going to arcades or where ever we decide to go hasn't been kind on my wallet</p>
          <p class="body-text">I should be back on track on the 28th, the day after she leaves.</p> 
          <p class="body-text">I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
