        <div class="post-section">
          <p class="bt">It's been a few days since I last updated you. A couple things have happened since we last spoke.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-section">
          <h2 class="mon-red-text">Romance over...</h2>
          <p class="bt">For starters, my romantic partner is no longer staying here.  I drove her to the airport and we said our goodbyes.</p>
          <p class="bt"> The two weeks we had to spend together has ended and I'm back to living alone. To be honest with you, I regret having spent so much time wishing I was alone.</p>
          <p class="bt">I wish I lived in the moment more. I should've accepted that our time together was relaxing time. Worrying so much about my productivity ruined our experience a bit.</p>
          <p class="bt">That's not to say that the time we spent together was bad. We both made memories we'll never forget and agreed we know and love each other on a deeper level. I wish that I savored it more. It's cliche to say but you don't know what you have until it's gone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-section">
          <h2 class="mon-red-text">Back on the grind.</h2>
          <p class="bt">I'm back on my shit now though.  Finished two good Deep Work sessions. I progressed through the Odin project by a good, healthy chunk. I'll do my best to fit in another deep work session today.</p>
          <p class="bt">My concentration is rusty. For the time being, giving my full attention to a task is a bit difficult. This will for sure improve as purposeful work becomes a habit again. I'm not too worried about it. </p>
          <p class="bt">Tomorrow, I'll reflect on how the first month of this year went and come up with a theme for the monthly posts. It'll serve me well to also make a template for weekly post.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-section">
          <h2 class="mon-red-text">Sleep.</h2>
          <p class="bt">Last night I didn't sleep so well. It's because I was too stimulated from work and kept trying to sleep when my body wanted to stay awake. And apparently , my landlady is a fucking blacksmith hammering away at something. So that doesn't help.</p>
          <p class="bt">This night I'll make sure to wear ear plugs and start this wind down routine : </p>
          <ul class="bt">
            <li>After I've finished deep work or my daily toils, I'm letting my mind relax</li>
            <li>I'll meditate and read a book and drink some tea</li>
            <li>My last meal will be around 8pm-9pm</li>
            <li>I'll be in bed by 10:30pm</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="post-section">
          <h2 class="mon-red-text">Going forward.</h2>
          <p class="bt">I'm excited to see how my life is going to progress now that I have every variable under my control. I've been having visions of success. While I lay awake on my bed, I see what life will be like for me. </p>
          <p class="bt">I see multiple successful Shopify apps that I treat more like money-making engines. </p>
          <p class="bt">I build the engines with code and feed it the ingredients that they need to make money.</p>
          <p class="bt">Stream of relevant eyes, superior customer support,  continuous refinement...</p>
          <p class="bt">The market is an open, crying mouth and I know how to feed it. I will feed it.</p>
          <p class="bt">I see myself walking into my  grocery store  and giving them a two weeks notice. I've achieved the goal nobody but me knew would work. </p>
          <p class="bt">I  look at the face of a coworker who doubted me and smile. I smile and know that we are both reaping the rewards of our minds. My mind is always changing. I admit when I'm wrong and believe that I can achieve anything. His mind is certain and inconsiderate. He won't get far and the only real difference between him and I is the way we CHOOSE TO THINK.</p>
          <p class="bt">I see myself being out and about in my van. Visiting every interesting spot in America with my romantic partner.</p>
          <p class="bt">Camping.</p>
          <p class="bt">Going to the beach.</p>
          <p class="bt">Learning how to make fires in the wilderness.</p>
          <p class="bt">Learning how to build interesting things like these <a class="mon-red-text underline" target=”_blank” href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olk-ex751I0">absolute beasts</a>.</p>
          <p class="bt">I want to see the world and live a way no one from my home town knows to be possible. I want to her to see it with me.</p>
          <p class="bt">I don't want these things, they are inevitable and they are going to happen.</p>
