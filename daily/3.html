          <p class="bt">I woke up around 5:45AM after getting about 5 hours of sleep.</p>
          <p class="bt">Yesterday my shift ended at 10PM and I had a morning shift today from 6AM-10AM. My schedule is fucking me.</p>
          <p class="bt">I'm back home now, journaling with Lourdes. I feel the same as the past two days - like there's a parachute on my back. When I try to move forward I'm just held back by how easy it is to enjoy the day and show her around for her vacation.</p>
          <p class="bt">There is no point crying over this anymore.</p>
          <p class="bt">I won't let myself get caught up on the fact I'm not working the hours I want on the things that have meaning to me. I'll just pick up where I left of on the 28th and keep as much momentum going as I can. Feeling sorry for myself because of the hit my productivity took is only going to give me a weak mindset and make me resent my guest.</p>
          <p class="bt">Neither of those are good.</p>

          <p class="bt">Feelings. Thoughts. Rants. Whatever. This all just as relevant in my journey as the actual coding is. I've learned that mental health in a hard endeavour is crucial to success. I won't forget about that again.</p>
