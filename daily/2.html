            Not much happened today. I tapped into a community call in Adonis School and I learned from the Odin Project for about an hour. At the very least I can say that I'm keeping my momentum. 
          </p>
          <p class="bt">I'm about to head over to work.</p>
          <p class="bt">Ugh...</p>
          <p class="bt">While I love having a guest over it feels like there isn't any space for me to just be deep in my thoughts and reflect on my life. I'll probably take to myself at a cafe with my notebook after work today.</p>
          <p class="bt">Now I will read Alex West's story for a bit before work.</p>

          <h2 class="mon-red-text">Pre-work insights from Alex</h2>
          <p class="bt">I like how Alex is both the player and controller in his journey</p>
          <p class="bt">What I mean is how he's taking action and reporting back the results of the day in his daily blog post, kinda like a coach would instruct a quarter-back after the game.</p>
          <p class="bt">This reflect allows him to change direction and decide when he's making good and bad decisions. Soon I'll have this space in my life to just develop and reflect.</p>
          <p class="bt">develop and reflect.</p>
          <p class="bt">develop and reflect.</p>
          <p class="bt">develop and reflect.</p>
          <p class="bt">Alex stresses the importance of setting goals that you can control, so for example, you can't control whether or not you hit $500 MRR by a certain time but you CAN control whether or not you launch the product three times or cold message X amount of people.</p>
