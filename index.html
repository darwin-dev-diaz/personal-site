    <h1>This site will grow along with my development skills.</h1>

    <h2>What is the site going to be?</h2>
    <h2>What path am I on?</h2>
    <p>I'm on a journey to achieve wealth and health. My two main focuses are making money through SaaS (Software as a Service) products and, over the course of 5 years, becoming a calisthenics beast. I feel no rush to get to where I need to be, I'm enjoying the journey and see that as the greatest reward for the sacrifices I've made to even get here.
    </p>
    <p>This is how the SaaS road map looks like in my head:</p>
    <div class="journey">
        <h3>My journey to wealth</h3>
        <div class="learning">
            <h4>Learning</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="micro-saas">
            <h4>Micro SaaS</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="saas">
            <h4>SaaS</h4>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What stage am I in?</h2>
    <h2>The story so far...</h2>
